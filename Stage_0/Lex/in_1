In this document, we have learned to use LEX to build a lexical analyzer. 
A lexical analyzer generated by LEX can be used for lexical analysis of ExpL. 
Lexical analysis is the inital stage of compiling a source language. 
We will learn more about how to use the lexical analyzer in later stages of the 
documentation.
